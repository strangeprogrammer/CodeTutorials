##SETTING UP THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND DJANGO

In order to be able to use this project, you will have to set up a python virtual environment (basically just allows you to keep a separate version of python and python packages on the system). This can be done with the following commands on Linux (which should all be done in the context of a system using 'python3'):

	# At least this version of 'virtualenv' should be used
	pip3 install virtualenv==16.4.1
	cd /var/www/html/CodeTutorials
	virtualenv -p python3 ./djangobox

The following commands are what you should always use to anoint your command prompt with the virtual environment before performing development or package management:

	cd ./djangobox
	source ./bin/activate

The correct version of 'Django' can then be installed in the virtual environment:

	pip install Django==2.1.7

The following command can then be used to exit the virtual environment:

	deactivate

## SETTING UP THE SERVER

Run:

	cd /var/www/html/CodeTutorials/djangobox
	source ./bin/activate
	cd ./src
	./manage.py makemigrations
	./manage.py migrate
	./manage.py collectstatic <<<"yes"

Then you can run the following for development:

	./manage.py runserver

## INFORMATION ON APACHE AND PRODUCTION LEVEL USAGE

The file 'WSGI_Config.txt' contains the relevant lines that you'll want to put in your apache settings in order to run the project on an apache server (assuming it's located at '/var/www/html/CodeTutorials'). You should be able to just start your apache server afterward and navigate to the relevant URLs of your choice.

The file 'djangobox/src/CodeTutorials/urls.py' contains information about static URLs that MUST be heeded if putting the server into a production environment. If you're just developing, however, that shouldn't be a problem. Note that the command 'collectstatic', which is used to copy static files to the appropriate location before usage, will only work on apps listed under 'INSTALLED_APPS' in 'djangobox/src/CodeTutorials/settings.py'.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

If necessary, remove the database with 'rm ./db.squlite3'.
To create a super user to help manage the server and model contents, run './manage.py createsuperuser', and you will be allowed access to 'localhost:8000/admin/' (though the port will be different if you're running the built-in server (8000) or apache (80)).
