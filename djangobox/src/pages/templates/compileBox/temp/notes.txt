test -z "$(docker ps -q 2>/dev/null)" && osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'  //Docker exit
docker ps -q | xargs -L1 docker stop		//much less graceful exit
open --background -a Docker		//graceful start



//BASH FILE

//must write user output to main.c file
docker build -t ctest.txt .		//uses main.c automatically (compilation)
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app ctest.txt >> useroutput.txt	//ctest is reponame? (execution)

//Echo user output to webpage

rm useroutput.txt		//Remove file which was users output
rm main.c			//Remove file which was users output
//Remove docker containers everytime?
