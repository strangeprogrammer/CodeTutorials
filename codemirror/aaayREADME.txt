WHAT EVERYTHING I ADDED CURRENTLY DOES/DOESNT DO: (dir:compileBox and compileBox.js, runit.sh)

- When runIt.php us displayed on webpage

- User can enter text (code) into textbox

- Upon pressing submission forms are used to extract code and write it to Payload/main.c

- Bash Script is executed: (THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE IN SERVER ROOT DIRECTORY I BELIEVE, htdocs for me)

PROBLEM - Am unable to use "docker" command in script (Cant automate?)
   - create container and compile code
   - run code and write output to file temp/useroutput.txt




***LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, WE OBVIOUSLY DO NOT HAVE TO USE ALL OF THIS IF IT IS A POOR DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION.
